# Modern pollen data for North America

Modern pollen data for North America from the Whitmore et al. 2005 pollen database. The database is described in *Modern pollen data from North America and Greenland for multi-scale paleoenvironmental applications* (*Quaternary Science Reviews* **24**: 1828-1848), and is openly available via the [University of Ottawa Laboratory for Paleoclimatology and Climatology](http://www.lpc.uottawa.ca). A mirror is found on the [Williams Lab website](https://williamspaleolab.github.io).
