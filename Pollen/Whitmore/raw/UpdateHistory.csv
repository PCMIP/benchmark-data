"WHITMORE ET AL. 2005 - MODERN POLLEN DATABASE FOR NORTH AMERICA AND GREENLAND, v.1.8",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
UPDATE HISTORY,,,,,,,,,
Version,Date Released,Author of changes,Changes,,,,,,
1.8,2016-04-16,K Gajewski,Several sites from the old CCR modern sample group have been updated. This amounts to ~177 samples from eastern North America,,,,,,
,,,"Most of these are unpublished data from Al Swain, K Gajewski, Marge Winkler and Gil Peterson; these were counted at UWisc in the 1970s for the COHMAP project",,,,,,
,,,"The count sheets were obtained and data completely reentered from scratch, then merged into the this file by overwriting the old file, after checking the 2 for differences",,,,,,
,,,"Major change: Pinus counts updated; in a number of samples, Pinus undiff were simply missing, or in some cases, Pinus diploxylon and haploxylon were lumped into Pinus (in versions 1.7 and below)",,,,,,
,,,Some rare types are now included when they were simply missing in earlier versions; in some cases species or subgenus delimitations had been lumped at the genus level; there are now distinguished,,,,,,
,,,"Remember that this is a research database, and not an archive. Aquatics, for example are totally missing in this version. See NEOTOMA for a complete archive of these data.",,,,,,
,,,Updated samples are coloured in YELLOW on the pollen sheet,,,,,,
,,,"In GREEN are CCR samples which have not been updated, as I couldn’t find the count sheet or match it to the database sample; these may have the Pinus errors, for example",,,,,,
,,,"The DB Code was updated to the CCR number to make it easier to trace samples. Also, the sitename was changed to the one from the count sheets. NB: the site name has been changed on the POLLEN DATA sheet only and not on the others",,,,,,
,,,Thanks to Angele Leduc for entering the data from the count sheets.,,,,,,
,,,Thanks to Eric Grimm for discussions and detective work on these changes and to CCR staff for sending the old count sheets.,,,,,,
1.73,2013-02-21,M. Ladd,Corrected seasonal precip fields (columns BP to BS) so they are sums of the monthly totals rather than averages of monthly totals,,,,,,
1.72,2009-02-25,J. Williams,Corrected data error:  Samples ID2 4701-4774 lacked pollen counts (all values were 0).  Counts inserted.,,,,,,
1.71,2008-10-27,J. Williams,"Added 'YrOfSamp' information to samples collected by Eric Grimm, Sheri Fritz, and Dan Engstrom from the northern Great Plains (ID2:  4775-4837)",,,,,,
1.7,2008-09-25,J. Williams,1. GENERAL CHANGES,,,,,,
,,,a. Added 203 surface pollen samples (ID2: 4635 to 4837) from the following workers:,,,,,,
,,,                                                               i.      Kendra McLauchlan (Ohio),,,,,,
,,,                                                             ii.      Timme Donders (Florida),,,,,,
,,,                                                            iii.      Gene Wahl (Southern California),,,,,,
,,,                                                           iv.      Steve Jackson (NY),,,,,,
,,,                                                             v.      Eric Grimm (Northern Great Plains),,,,,,
,,,"b. Climate attributions for new samples provided by Patrick Bartlein, following procedures described in Whitmore et al. 2005",,,,,,
,,,"c. Tree cover attributions were provided by Jack Williams, following procedures described in Whitmore et al. 2005",,,,,,
,,,"d. Duplicate samples identified by Bianca Frechette (ID2:  3930, 3985, 3984, 4124) were removed from primary data table and placed in Removed Pollen Sites worksheet.  These sites had a SCD of 0 with four corresponding samples (ID2:  3893, 326, 330, 213).",,,,,,
,,,"e. A second zip file includes the original pollen data and metadata files contributed by the investigators, along with Excel conversion tables showing how Williams matched the investigator’s taxon names to the original taxon names to standard Whitmore et al. taxon names.  These associated datafiles allow users to use pollen types not included in the dataset.",,,,,,
,,,1. CLIMATE+BIOCLIMATE,,,,,,
,,,"a. Removed several extraneous columns from middle of worksheet:  id, lon, lat, elev   (note that ID2, ID1, LONDD, and LATDD in Columns A-F were kept)",,,,,,
,,,b. Removed ‘ptotal’– it was redundant with ‘pann’,,,,,,
,,,c. Rearranged columns so that monthly variables precede all derived (bioclimatic) variables.,,,,,,
,,,"d. Added seasonal means for monthly climate variables (TMAM, TJJA, TSON, TDJF, PMAM, PJJA, PSON, PDJF, SMAM, SJJA, SSON, SDJF)",,,,,,
,,,2. AVHRR,,,,,,
,,,"a. Tree-cover attributions for a 21x21km search window was added to the output datasets, for all samples",,,,,,
,,,"b. Total woody cover added to the output dataset, for all samples.  This is simply a sum of the broadleaved and needleleaved components.",,,,,,
,,,3. UNFINISHED BUSINESS,,,,,,
,,,a. Have not assigned DISCover and Federova land cover types to new samples,,,,,,
,,,b. Have not determined east/west assignments for pollen types.,,,,,,
,,,      c. Have not estimated positional errors for new samples.,,,,,,
1.61,2007-01-29,J Williams,Corrected incorrect values in the 'ID2' field of the 'East_West' worksheet.  This error only affected ID2 values >4311.  ,,,,,,
1.6,2006-10-30,J Williams,"Added table indicating whether certain pollen types should be considered eastern or western varieties, based upon the location of the sample site and the ranges of the parent species. ",,,,,,
1.55,2006-08-24,J Williams,"Corrected or expanded labels for Lithocarpus, Eriogonum, Ericales, Rumex/Oxyria, and Ericaceae Chamaedaphne/Ledum",,,,,,
1.54,2006-01-30,K Gajewski,"Metadata updated, and HVMR ID's updated in climate and avhrr sheets",,,,,,
1.53,2006-01-17,K Gajewski,Several <pollen sum> (in the vicinity of ID2:4420) did not equal the sum of the pollen grains. These were recomputed. Thanks again to M Peros.,,,,,,
1.52,2005-12-21,K Gajewski,"Added Fedorova et al (1994) Vegetation classes (see Paper, Figure 3)",,,,,,
,,,corrected label for Picea,,,,,,
1.51,2005-12-19,J Whitmore & K Gajewski,Several small corrections based on comments from M Peros,,,,,,
,,,"(a) Several sitenames were different between the different worksheets, these were simply made to concur.",,,,,,
,,,(b) Only significant change: NMHL & HVMR series did not match line-by-line between different worksheets - these were corrected,,,,,,
1.5,2005-08-02,J Williams,"An error was found in the script that assigned North American Seasonal Land Cover values (NASLCR; from the DISCover dataset) to surface sample locations. The assignment of other vegetation attributes was unaffected by this error. Therefore only the valuies in the AVHRR worksheet, NASLCR column are affected by this change. IN some version of the dataset, the NASCLR column is incorrectly lableed as ""Biome"" . THis was version used in the Williams et al Atlas.",,,,,,
1.4,2005-04-14,K Gajewski,Positional errors worksheet added. This was the first public release.,,,,,,
1.4,2004-12-29,J Whitmore,Version used in Whitmore et al paper,,,,,,
